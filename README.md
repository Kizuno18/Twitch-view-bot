[Official YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/o87U8asusyo)

- Install dependencies first ( You have to be in the folder of the bot ) </br>
**MacOS/Linux:** ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt``` </br>
**Windows:** ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
- Start up cookie monster that is in /tools/cookie_monster.py
- Log in into some accounts and get the cookies
- Configure config.ini to your liking
- Start the bot and laugh maniacally

## Speech recognition

The bot offers **_speech recognition_** that aims to make the bots appear like real people.

### How does it work?

There is a file in tools/chatting called ```speech_recognition_responses.txt```

In that file you will see some examples I left, to make full use of the bot place certain sentences you will be saying in your livestream to make the bots respond. 

For example if you say " Would you like me to play wow or lol " you should add the following to the ```speech_recognition_responses.txt```

```
:wow or lol:
I really like wow
Idc any game really
lol is better in my opinion
```
And so on, you get the gist. This way you can phrase the sentence however you like but the bots will know the question is wow or lol.

 ## Disclamier

 The bot I am making for the YouTube series is for educational purposes only. If anybody wishes to use this bot in order to boost their ranking on Twitch I am not responsible for that nor do I suggest doing that in the first place. 

 Thank you for understanding.
